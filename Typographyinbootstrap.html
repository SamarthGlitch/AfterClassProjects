    <p><h1 class="anitext">Thomas Thwaites</h1>In 2010, decided he wanted to <mark>build a 
        toaster from scratch</mark>. He walked into a shop, purchased the cheapest toaster 
        he could find, and promptly went
         home and broke it down piece by piece.
Thwaites had assumed the toaster would
 be a <abbr>rltvly</abbr> simple machine. By the time he was 
 finished deconstructing it, however, there were more than <mark>400 components</mark> laid out on his floor. 
 The toaster contained over <mark>100 different materials</mark> with three of the primary ones being <mark>plastic</mark>, <mark>nickel</mark>, 
 and <mark>steel</mark>.
